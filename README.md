A Simple Simulink Simulation for Longitudinal Tracking Control of a Battery Electric Vehicle
This Simulink model implements a longitudinal tracking control simulation for a battery electric vehicle (BEV) using a standard drive cycle (FTP75) as the speed reference. The goal is to evaluate the performance of a simple PI-based control strategy in tracking a target velocity profile by manipulating the traction and braking signals.
